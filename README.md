### **2. Drop-off Rate Across Courses**  

| Course                | First Video Views | Last Video Views | Drop-off Rate (%) |
|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Machine Learning (ML)  | **1000K**         | **15K**          | **98.5%**         |
| Deep Learning (DL)    | **461K**          | **17K**          | **96.3%**         |
| NLP                   | **241K**          | **81K**          | **66.4%**         |

### **3. Course Length vs Retention**  

| Course                | Total Videos | Average Views per Video | Median Views per Video | Total Views |
|-----------------------|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Machine Learning (ML)  | 133          | 765.7K                  | 570.0K                 | **10.18M**  |
| Deep Learning (DL)    | 84           | 624.5K                  | 500.0K                 | **5.25M**   |
| NLP                   | 8            | 1126.2K                 | 990.0K                 | **9010.0K** |

ðŸ’¡ **Key Insight:**  
- **Longer courses (ML & DL) suffer high drop-offs**, while shorter courses (NLP) maintain better engagement.  
- **NLP has the highest average & median views per video**, suggesting students prefer shorter, more concise courses.

---

### **4. Views Distribution and Trends**
- **First videos of each course receive significantly higher views** than subsequent ones, indicating strong initial interest.
- **Mid-course videos experience a sharp decline**, suggesting that many students start but donâ€™t finish.
- **Courses with fewer videos (like NLP) retain more users until the end**, reinforcing the idea that **shorter courses might be more effective**.

---

### **Final Insights and Recommendations**

âœ… **Shorter courses retain more students**:  
The NLP course, with only 8 videos, has a **much lower drop-off rate (66.4%)**, whereas ML and DL lose **~97-98% of their viewers** over time.

âœ… **Longer courses might benefit from segmentation**:  
Instead of one long playlist, breaking ML and DL into **smaller, targeted mini-courses** might improve retention. For example:

1. **ML Prerequisites**  
2. **Working with Data**  
3. **Data Preprocessing**  
4. **ML Regression Algorithms**  
5. **ML Classification Algorithms**  
6. **ML Clustering Algorithms**
**etc**
